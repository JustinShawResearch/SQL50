**Problem Title:**&nbsp;[The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-employees-which-report-to-each-employee/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

**Problem Number:** 1731

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Key Concepts:** `SELF JOIN`, `GROUP BY`

## My Approach:
NEW CONCEPT: `SELF JOIN`<br>
When we need compare rows within the same table we can use a `SELF JOIN`. In this example, we wanted to compare each row to see if their `employee_id` matched with `reports_to`. By doing so, we filter out (using `ON`) all the employees who are not managers. 



## SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT mgr.employee_id, mgr.name, COUNT(emp.name) AS reports_count, ROUND(AVG(emp.age)) AS average_age
FROM Employees mgr
JOIN Employees emp
ON mgr.employee_id = emp.reports_to # This condition gives only managers
GROUP BY mgr.employee_id  # Groups all the distinct managers
ORDER BY mgr.employee_id
```
