**Problem Number:** 1731

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Key Concepts:** `SELF JOIN`, `GROUP BY`

## Explanation:
NEW CONCEPT: `SELF JOIN`

When we need compare rows within the same table we can use a `SELF JOIN`. In this example, we wanted to compare each row to see if their `employee_id` matched with `reports_to`. By doing so, we filter out (using `ON`) all the employees who are not managers. 

## SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT mgr.employee_id, mgr.name, COUNT(emp.name) AS reports_count, ROUND(AVG(emp.age)) AS average_age
FROM Employees mgr
JOIN Employees emp
ON mgr.employee_id = emp.reports_to # This condition gives only managers
GROUP BY mgr.employee_id  # Groups all the distinct managers
ORDER BY mgr.employee_id
```
