**Problem Title:** [Managers With at Least 5 Direct Reports](https://leetcode.com/problems/managers-with-at-least-5-direct-reports/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

> Very similar to [The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-employees-which-report-to-each-employee/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50) found in 5. Adavanced Select and Joins

**Problem Number:** 570

**Difficulty:** Medium (should be easy)

**Key Concepts:** `SELF JOIN` & `HAVING`

## Explanation:
CONCEPT: `SELF JOIN`

1. We use `SELF JOIN` on this example as we want to compare rows to each other. We use the condition `ON mgr.id = emp.managerId` to only have managers in our rows.
2. We `GROUP BY` as there can be multiple rows of the same manager (due to multiple people reporting to the same manager)
3. We use `HAVING`after `GROUP BY` to select only managers that have more than 5 rows (1 row = 1 report from and employee)


## SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT mgr.name
FROM Employee mgr
JOIN Employee emp
ON mgr.id = emp.managerId
GROUP BY mgr.id
HAVING COUNT(mgr.id) >= 5
```
