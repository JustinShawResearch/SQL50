**Problem Title:** [Employee Bonus](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-bonus/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

**Problem Number:** 577

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Key Concepts:** `LEFT JOIN`

## My Approach:
CONCEPT: `LEFT JOIN`
Since not all employees might have a corresponding entry in the Bonus table, and we want to list ALL employees, we must do a `LEFT JOIN`.  

## SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT name, bonus
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empID = b.empID
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 or b.bonus is NULL
```
